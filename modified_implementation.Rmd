## Get data
```{r}
season_2018 <- fread('./season_2018.csv')
season_2019 <- fread('./season_2019.csv')
season_2020 <- fread('./season_2020.csv')

```

## Preprocessing - superbowl winners
```{r}
#2018
season_2018$super_bowl_winner <- 0
season_2018$super_bowl_winner[season_2018$Teams == "Eagles"] <- 1

#2019
season_2019$super_bowl_winner <- 0
season_2019$super_bowl_winner[season_2019$Teams == "Patriots"] <- 1

#2020
season_2020$super_bowl_winner <- 0
season_2020$super_bowl_winner[season_2020$Teams == "Chiefs"] <- 1

#2021
season_2021$super_bowl_winner <- 0
season_2021$super_bowl_winner[season_2021$Teams == "Buccaneers"] <- 1
```

## training/ testing data
```{r}
#join 2018-2020 for training data
training <- rbind(season_2018, season_2019, season_2020)

#testing data
testing <- season_2021
```

```{r}
training[1]
```

## drop unused columns
```{r}
training <- training[,-'Teams']
```

## training size
```{r}
#number of rows that indicate winning teams
table(training$super_bowl_winner == 1)
```
## Percentage of minority observation
```{r}
sum(training$super_bowl_winner)/nrow(training)*100
```

## Oversampling for data imbalance
```{r}
#desired length of training
n_train <- 1000

#probability of minority class being generated
p_minority <- 0.2

new_training <- ROSE(as.factor(super_bowl_winner) ~ ., data  = training, N = n_train, p = p_minority, seed = 412)$data
```

## New training table
```{r}
table(new_training$super_bowl_winner == 1)
```

## train model
```{r}
mylogit <- glm(super_bowl_winner ~ Wins + Loses + Ties + win_percent + total_points + total_rushing_yards
               + total_passing_yards + total_yards, data = training)
```

## test model
```{r}
testing$prediction <- predict(mylogit, newdata = testing)
```

```{r}
